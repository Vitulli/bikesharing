# Citi Bike Demographics and Temporal Usage Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
#### This analysis was done in order to evaluate whether a similar business could be created in Des Moines, Iowa.  The data that was used to see patterns of behavior were drawn from a similar operating company in New York City.  The study focuses on to main items, User Demographics and Temporal Usage.

#### For the analysis Tableau is used to demonstrate these concepts using Heat Maps and Line Graphs.

## Results
#### First, concentrating on the Heat Map Analysis three main facts become apparent:  
1.	Bike Usage is centered around commute timeframes on Monday through Friday and 8 AM to 5 PM.
2.	Weekend bike usage is present and evenly distributed around daylight hours.

#### Secondly, Data reveals... 

1.	The service is almost entirely used by men whether they are a Subscriber or Customer.

## Summary
#### Overall, I believe this dataset is flawed to derive the conclusion we are looking for and I believe a different look at this analysis should be taken.  First, the data was drawn to take advantage of summer tourist months and it is clear that a large part of our usage is from local commuters.  Secondly, there is no accounting for winter months when the roadways may be treacherous due to ice or rain conditions so there is no knowledge of what kind of usage/revenue may see and Des Moines weather conditions are typically worse than NYC.  Lastly the one great take away from this data is that there is virtually no female usage of the product, and this may be a marketing opportunity to gain more revenue.
